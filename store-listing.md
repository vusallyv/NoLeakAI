## Privacy Policy
Since your extension doesn't collect any data, you can use a simple privacy policy:

"Privacy Policy for NoLeakAI

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All processing happens locally in your browser. We do not have access to any information you type or any data about your usage of this extension."

## Host Permission Justification

**Permission Requested:** `https://chat.openai.com/*`

**Justification:** This permission is required for the extension to fulfill its single purpose of detecting sensitive data before it's sent to ChatGPT. The extension needs to:

1. **Inject content script** - To monitor the text input field on chat.openai.com
2. **Access page content** - To read the user's typed text before sending
3. **Intercept form submission** - To prevent sending when sensitive data is detected

**What the extension does with this permission:**
- Monitors the ChatGPT text input area for sensitive patterns
- Reads only the text content that the user is about to send
- Shows a warning dialog if sensitive data is detected
- Does NOT collect, store, or transmit any data
- Does NOT access any other parts of the page or browser

**Why this permission is minimal and necessary:**
- Only requests access to chat.openai.com (ChatGPT)
- No access to other websites or browser data
- Required for the core functionality to work
- No alternative way to achieve the same security benefit
